# optimization_api

To solve an example problem using the API:

1. Download one of the above files.
2. replace the cost function with yours (make sure you take care of the denormalization of parameters; this API assumes parameters range between zero and one. You will have to denormalize the parameters before evaluation of the cost function.)
3. pick an IP that is the closest to your geographical location.
